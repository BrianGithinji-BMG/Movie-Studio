## Multivariate Analysis
- A multiple linear regression model was used to predict ROI based on runtime, average rating, and genre.
- The model showed that runtime and average rating are not strong predictors of ROI, with an R-squared value of 0.001.

## Correlation Analysis
- There is a weak positive correlation between vote average and ROI (0.2019).
- There is a weak positive correlation between runtime minutes and ROI (0.0097).

## Linear Regression Models
- Vote average is not a statistically significant predictor of ROI.
- Runtime minutes are not a statistically significant predictor of ROI.
